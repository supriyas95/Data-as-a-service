## CreditRiskMonitor (CRM) DaaS Strategy

Led a strategic consulting engagement to guide **CreditRiskMonitor (CRM)** in launching a scalable **Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)** platform that delivers real-time, API-based credit risk insights (FRISK®, PAYCE®) into client workflows.

### Key Highlights
- **Market Opportunity**: Addressed a $25B+ growing DaaS market; positioned CRM to compete with D&B, RapidRatings through embedded data delivery.
- **Client Insights**: Integrated VOC from Fortune 1000 clients (e.g., Honeywell) demanding seamless API access and predictable pricing.
- **Differentiation Strategy**: Proposed CRM's value as “**embedded risk intelligence**” via integrations with Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, Power BI.
- **Go-to-Market Plan**: Recommended hybrid-tiered API pricing (Basic → Premium), MVP launch, phased rollout, and enterprise onboarding support.
- **Execution Focus**: Suggested forming an integration team, building pre-configured connectors, and addressing risks (cannibalization, complexity).

### Outcome
Delivered a comprehensive roadmap to position CRM’s DaaS as a **flagship offering**, drive retention, and unlock new revenue through real-time credit risk integration.
